GTEx RNAseq data processing
===========================

The [Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx)](http://www.gtexportal.org/home/) aims to create a comprehensive public atlas of gene expression in human tissues.
I am not affiliated with the project, but wanted to use some of their results.
This script extracts a small amount of data from the public release of "rpkm" data on [dbGaP] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v1.p1).
These data are then tidied up for exporting to other programs.
